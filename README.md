# Lipstick_try_on

Sometimes it is not easy to find a perfect lipstick shade, especially if we are doing shopping online.
That's the reason why this program is created to help users swatch lipstick by uploading their own photo (probably a photo of their twist)
After uploading a photo, the user can pick one shade of the collection. Also, the user could use arrow keys to move the shade over the uploaded photo
in order to see if the lipstick color looks good on their skin.
To give some "movements" for the program, lipsticks' images will automatically change every 2 seconds. For the convenient, color name
is attached to its' own image.
